These resources were compiled for the [[https://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/slc][Student Learning Commons of Simon Fraser University]] to help students writing their academic work in French. They are based in large part on recurring questions and issues presented by students during one on one consultations.

They can be accessed in [[https://prosoitos.github.io/academic-writing-in-french_resources/][my style]] or in [[https://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/slc/writing/resources-academic-writing-french][the SFU library style]]. They are also available as [[https://github.com/prosoitos/Resources_academic-writing-in-French/files/1836067/resources.pdf][pdf]].
